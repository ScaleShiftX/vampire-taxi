The chassis, wheel, and joint are all separate (none are children)

The joint is positioned at the attachment point between the chassis and the wheel

Linear limits are ALL enabled (0 to 0 except for Y which is 0.2 to -0.4)

Linear motors are ALL off

Linear springs are off except for the Y spring which is on to act as suspension travel

Angular limits are all on except for X. Presumably X can rotate totally freely (axle), Y is limited (30 to -30 steering) so the wheel can't turn inwards or outwards too far, and Z is entirely limited (0 to 0) to prevent camber.

Angular motors are all off except for Y, though I'm unsure of what that does.

Angular springs are all off

Node A is the chassis
Node B is the wheel
Collision between nodes is excluded

Joint's basis must match chassis and wheel bases (best to have them all world-aligned)
