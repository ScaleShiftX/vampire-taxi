Giant googly eyes
Vampirism (pedestrians OR vehicles) 
Cop cars which will chase you if they see you vampirize someone/something
Your car gets better and better-looking the more you vampirize (gold spinning rims for example, upgrade from gas to electric for better acceleration) 
You have to do some amount of actually taxiing to keep up the guise of being real, and also to afford to charge your car (bitch is electric (only after the upgrade, initially gas)) 
You go home to your garage
and you're still a car driving around in your house
your giant, garage-house
with your taxi wife



your car has a bouncing suspension so you can "jump" up the front of your car to bite down on people


you can eat cop cars if you attack them from behind
cop cars catch you if they get you from behind. maybe instead of arresting you they straight up murder you lol

100m east/west road

HUGE AMOUNTS of blood when you kill someone
