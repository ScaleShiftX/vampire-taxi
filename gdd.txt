Vampirism (pedestrians OR vehicles) 
Cop cars which will chase you if they see you vampirize someone/something
Your car gets better and better-looking the more you vampirize (gold spinning rims for example, upgrade from gas to electric for better acceleration) 
You have to do some amount of actually taxiing to keep up the guise of being real, and also to afford to charge your car (bitch is electric (only after the upgrade, initially gas)) 
You go home to your garage
and you're still a car driving around in your house
your giant, garage-house
