Set the car to be resting directly on the origin

Set the car's forward vector to point along Godot's -Z = Blender's -Y
(Blender uses Z for the up axis whereas Godot uses Y for the up axis)

Make each wheel:
- a separate object
- with their origins at their centres
- - in object mode > select the object > object dropdown in the top-left > set origin > center of mass (volume)
- - Then press Alt+g to reset transform
- and their forward vectors in the direction of travel

Add fangs to taxi

Model pedestrians

Come up with some upgrades (which can double as variation for NPC cars). Ex: gold spinning rims, cop car stuff
